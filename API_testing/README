These is the tool for testing of CS-API.

This project is written on Java and bash (a wrapper for Java)

Each file located in ./src/ represents the usage logic of the CS-API call.
The source code is full of comment. 
For getting the CLI parameters the lib org.apache.common is used.
There are configuration file locates in ./etc/configuration.properties with following items:
	1. Connection properties to the SERVICE
	2. Logging properties.


The script ./test.sh is the wrapper for the JAVA VM. The script does following:
	1. Receives the set of input parameters via CLI (Common Line Interface)
	2. Gets the part of the SERVICE log.
	3. Runs the JAVA-file (from ./src/) with predefined CLASSPATH.
	4. Transmits the STDOUT and STDERR of JAVA VM into log file.

As an example of the usage you may look into ./src/CsGet.java

The following line will run the JAVA-class:
	
	./test.sh ./src/CsGet.java -a "Account_N_2781128" -b "23213122414" -c "12124" -d "23214"

	This command will show the parameter which the class receives:
		./test.sh ./src/CsGet.java -h
