     This script sends SNMP messages generated as trap or clear to NMS host.
     This script has a configuration file which contains all necessary
values, such as:
      - A list of SNMP_service instances (hosts);
      - A list of metrics (counters) for all SNMP_service instances;
      - A list of SNMP configuration parameters (community, version);
      - IP address of the host which receives SNMP traps (NMS);
      - Paths to log, lock, and history files.

     The script has a mechanism which not allows to run more than one its
instance simultaneously.

     For sending the clear messages (signal that problem has been solved) 
the history file is used. It keeps the pairs Service_name-Metric_name. As
soon as problem is found this pair adds to history file. When problem has
solved this pair is removed from history.

     Log file contains the results of key calls and steps during the work.

     The path to configuration file is hardcoded.

     TODO:
       1. Implement reading configuration file from command line.
       2. Implement current configuration without running the script.
       3. Implement getting trap message from 'snmp_alets.out' file.
	   4. Add description of enterprice SNMP tree.

This script can be used in cron:
     0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * . $HOME/.profile && <PATH_TO_SNMP_trapsender>/SNMP_trapsender.pl
