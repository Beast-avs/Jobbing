     This script sends SNMP messages generated as trap to NMS host.
     This script has a configuration file which contains all necessary
values, such as:
      - A list of SNMP_service instances (hosts);
      - A list of metrics (counters) for all SNMP_service instances;
      - A list of SNMP configuration parameters (community, version);
      - IP adress of the host which receives SNMP traps (NMS);
      - Pathes to log and lock files.

     The script has a mechanism which not allows to run more than one its
instance simultaneously.

     Log file contains the results of key calls and steps during the work.

     The path to configuration file is hardcoded.

     TODO:
       1. Implement reading configuration file from command line.
       2. Implement current configuration without running the script.
       3. Implement getting trap message from 'snmp_alets.out' file.
	   4. Add description of enterprice SNMP tree.

This script can be used in cron:
     0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * . $HOME/.profile && <PATH_TO_SNMP_trapsender>/SNMP_trapsender.pl
