This is a solution according to task:

Searching for answers on the internet is perfectly acceptable, but key references should be recorded.
These exercises are to demonstrate knowledge of OO techniques, so please use them wherever possible.
1) Take as source the Cities provided at the end of the mail and write a script city_info.pl that when
passed the city name via
city_info.pl --city <city name> [--filename <optional filename holding the city info>]
will print out a small summary of the details of the city.
Please write this entirely using OO techniques.
Please write this in as few statements as possible.
There is no limitation on the Perl Modules you can use.
2) Take the city example above and provide summary information for all cities
Please load, construct and display all city object from a data file in as few lines as possible.
Plus the file must be loaded into a string in one operation. (To test knowledge of an idiom).
3) The data set for the cities including ID, City, Country, and Population, however when a
city is a capital city, it should output additionally the population of the country.
Discuss how you would modify the script to achieve this using standard OO techniques.
4) What is the difference between an Object Accessor and a Class Accessor.
Data for Test.

You may run this progarmm:
./city_info.pl --city=<CITY> [--filename=<CITIES_FILE>] [--format=<FORMAT>]
where <FORMAT> is an output format. Supported:
  - cli_s - data represented in single line with space as delimiter
  - cli_c - data represented in single line with comma as delimiter
  - multiline - Data represented line by line
  - xml - XML data format
  
The program divided into 2 parts:
 - myParser - get the requested city and store the info into hash.
 - myDisplay - this module represents data. Other words, here the data is preperes for output.
 
 Actually there is need two more (at least) modules: 
  - Configuartor - reads the config data from file (config parameters sush as path to file with cities, path to log, etc).
  - Logger - module which stores the events during programm working.
  
  I have no idea how to know the property 'capital' of the city without introducing yet another file with this properties, as an ilustration:
  ./conf/capitals.txt
  USA - Washington
  Ukraine - Kyiv
  Russia - Moscow
  ...
  
  Now I'm reading about difference Object Accessor and a Class Accessor.
