Dump releases and logs (KSDRL).

The idea is:
     The release archives which are stored on server (CIT) will be moved to backup server if it older than defined days in configuration file.
     The defined amount (set in configuration file) of releases SHOULD to stay on CIT despite the age.
     
	For example:
		in folder ../artifacts/App1/ there are releases: 
			20070211110012,
			20080101010101, 
			20080202020002, 
			20090211101900.
	after the processing the amount of remailning realeases is 3 (set in configuration file), it means that the realase 20070211110012 
	will be moved to backup server. The final content is:
			20080101010101, 
            20080202020002, 
            20090211101900.

Requirements:
	1. Flexible configuration of the following parameters:
		- Source of the artifacts;
		- Backup server;
		- Age of release;
		- Amount of releases stay in folder;
		- Set of admins who should to get notification.
	2. Tracking the copying process (event logging). Different log modes.
	3. Set up main parameters via configuration file.
	4. Flexible sending messages.
	5. Readable output in log file with the possible ways of fixing.
	6. Ability to run the utility in test mode - outputs the status of current operation but do not move release.
	
Description:
    This utility is run on daily basis (managed by cron). When the release (which age is older than defined amount of days) is found it will be moved to
    backup server. While moving releases the amount of archives which are left on source server (CIT) will be considered. This means that a few archives 
    SHOULD stay on CIT. 
    
    Utility gets the files via SSH, FTP, FILE (in case of moving locally). In case of SSH the authorization keys should be used.
    
    The progress bas is implemented into utility. It helps to track the coying process.
    
    The logger modes is standard: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.
    
    There a few critical errors:
    	- configuration file s not set;
    	- log file is not set;
    	- destination is not set;
    	- wrong format of destination.
    	
    After processing the set of release archives the following info will be received (in form of statistics):
    	- name of application which releases were moved;
    	- the list of releases which are left on CIT;
    	- the list of moved releases;
    	- the list of applications where releases are oldr than defined age;
    	- errors during the work.
    
 TODO:
 	1. Review the code. Avoid performance issues (connected to usage foreach instead of while).
 	2. Implement a CLI parameters support.
 	3. Implement logrotate in Logger module. According to rules (defined in config file) create a new log file and theold one archive or rename 
 		(see logrotate for details). Think about using of Log4perl.
 	4. Provide a short info about free disk space which is left on backup server.
 	5. Review the format and content of statistics (send by email).
