This tool sends SNMP messages generated as trap or clear to NMS host.

This program written on PERL

It has a configuration file which contains all necessary values, such as:
      - A list of SNMP_service instances (hosts);
      - A list of metrics (counters) for all SNMP_service instances;
      - A list of SNMP configuration parameters (community, version);
      - IP address of the host which receives SNMP traps (NMS);
      - Paths to log, lock, and history files.
Configuration file has structure of XML for better reading and manipulating.

It has a mechanism which not allows to run more than one instance of it 
simultaneously.

For sending the clear messages (signal that problem has been solved) 
the history file is used. It keeps the pairs Service_name-Metric_name. As
soon as problem has found this pair adds to history file. When problem has
solved this pair is removed from history.

Log file contains the results of key calls and steps during the work.
The event are stored in different log modes.

The path to configuration file is hardcoded.

TODO:
       1. Implement reading configuration file from command line.
       2. Implement current configuration without running the script.
       3. Implement getting trap message from 'snmp_alets.out' file.
       4. Add support of another trap sender. Convert SNMP trap to format:
		     <severity> <alarmtype> <clearmsgid> <progname> <date> <logmsgtype> <OLSmsgid>-<eventnumber> <dpclmsgid> <message text> 

This script can be used in cron:
     0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * . $HOME/.profile && <PATH_TO_Service_Trapsender>/Service_Trapsender.pl
